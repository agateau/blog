title: "Into the blue"

<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://blogs.kde.org/node/4565">Jonathan</a>, let me announce I am leaving Canonical at the end of the month, joining Blue Systems to work on KDE and Kubuntu.
I am quite excited by this new adventure, and looking forward to the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Since I will be working 5 days a week on KDE and Kubuntu, I am going to stop asking for donations. Thanks a lot to all of you who supported my work during this period.
