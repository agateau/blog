title: "Cars 2 DVD and Linux... an embarrassing story"

<img src="cars2.jpg" title="Cars 2" height="128" width="128" alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1152"/>Latest addition to my kids DVD library is the Cars 2 DVD. They usually watch movies using a small PC running XBMC, so I started to rip it. I use either K9Copy or Ogmrip to rip DVDs, both get the job done without problem these days.
<h2>Not so lucky</h2>
Unfortunately Cars 2 DVD is different: Even if it can play it, VLC lists 99 titles on the DVD, which sounds a bit too much. K9Copy crashes on it. Ogmrip gets stuck when it tries to rip any track.
<p>As I discovered later, Disney DVDs use a new protection system named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARccOS">ArccOS</a>. Searching on the Internet I realized I was not the only one having this problem, but appart from similarly unlucky users, I only found Windows shareware applications claiming to be able to rip those Disney DVDs.</p>
<h2>Delusional</h2>
<p>At this point I was desperate enough that I started a Windows XP VM and tried a few of these applications. Two of them failed, but the third one correctly ripped Cars 2... With a large watermark, it's a shareware after all, there is got to be a catch. As I couldn't find any other solution, I reluctantly paid 40&#8364; for the full version :(.</p>
<p>Note that I am not extremist to the point of refusing to pay for software, but I have a problem with paying 4 times the price of a legally bought DVD to be able to exercise my right to make a copy of it.</p>
<h2>Hope after all</h2>

<p>Shortly after paying, I switched to another tab of my browser and noticed a search I made actually uncovered an interesting <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1885267.html">forum thread</a>. This is where I learnt about ArccOS, but also where I discovered <a href="http://handbrake.fr">HandBrake</a>, a free software, multi-platform, video transcoder application I have never heard about... I installed it from the <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~stebbins/+archive/handbrake-releases">Ubuntu PPA</a>, tried it... You guessed it: It can rip Cars 2 DVD without any problem...</p>
<p>So as a conclusion, even if HandBrake documentation <a href="https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/IsIsnt">claims it is not a DVD ripper</a>, if a DVD does not let itself get ripped, do not capitulate before giving HandBrake a try. You could very well save a few dozen euros in the process...</p>
