Finally, a new release! This one comes packed with some substantial changes:

The game difficulty has been adjusted: levels are shorter and a bit harder, making the game more challenging. One now gains back up to 4 seconds of extra time when customers are satisfied.

As you can see from the screenshot above, the background for the pirate world, which [I was working on](/2014/wip-pirate-world-background), has been integrated.

Burgers are now more "realistic": all stages now have at least one meat or fish ingredient, two sauces cannot be stacked on each other.

The Japan world now has a boss:

The "new world" sequences are a bit longer: they show the heroine leaving the current world and boarding a plane to the next world. The maps have also been improved.

Hope you like this version, I am especially interested in your feedback regarding the change on difficulty. Does it make the game more challenging? Is it too hard? Still too easy? Let me know.
