Burger Party 0.13 is out! In this version I finally gave the Pirate world an "end boss". The US world had a [wrestler][], the Pirate world has a pirate chief, complete with a parrot on his shoulder:

[wrestler]: /2013/wrestler-v2

This version also comes with some new achievements:

- Three "All stars" achievements: finish all levels of world 1, 2, 3 with three stars.
- Three "Perfect" achievements: get a perfect in all levels of world 1, 2, 3.

It's also been a long time since I last added an ingredient. Starting with 0.13, you can now spice your burgers with mustard!

A few other minor changes have been done as well: If you speak French, then you'll be happy to know the game is now fully translated. Also, a short sound is now played in the game over screen.

The game is getting solid now. I don't want to claim I am 90% done because everybody knows the last 10% take 90% of the time :), but my list of things which *must* be done before a first release is shrinking. I hope you like this [this new version](/projects/burgerparty/).
