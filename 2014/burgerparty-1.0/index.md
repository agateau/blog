It's release time!

Burger Party 1.0 is finally out and available on Google Play! I spent a lot of time working on this game, and I think it has now reached the point where I can publish it without being too much ashamed about it :) At the time I am writing this, the final version has been uploaded to Google Play and I am impatiently waiting for it to go live. This F5 key is going to wear out really quick if it does not get there soon...

Since this is a real public release, Burger Party comes with a real launch trailer:

It also comes with a nice and sweet Google Play button...

What's next? Promotion! I am going to put my marketing cap on and start annoying... Err, I mean asking game-related sites for (preferably nice) reviews of the game.

You can help with promotion too! If you like the game, rate it or write a nice review on Google Play, talk about it to your friends, family members, colleagues, post man, grocery clerk, whoever you think would enjoy some good burger fun. Of course, sharing this page on Facebook, Twitter, Google+... wherever you hang out, is a great idea as well!

That's it for now, I hope you enjoy playing Burger Party as much as I enjoyed creating it.
