Hi, I have been working on refreshing the background of the pirate world lately. After a few iterations, I settled on adding a gallion in the background. It's not finished yet, but it already gives the scene a different feeling, Aaahhrr!

Need to add some highlights and shadows, refine some details and it should be good to go.
