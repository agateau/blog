A little more than one month after the public release of Burger Party, here comes the first update. The main change of this version is the introduction of three difficulty modes:
<!-- more -->

- kids: no global timer, customers are more patient
- normal: just like before
- expert: shorter times, less patient customers, no arrow indicating the next item to add

This change should make the game more interesting to young children: they get the challenge to pick the ingredients in the right order, without the stress of the global timer. Note that even if the global timer is no longer there, they still get 1, 2 or 3 stars depending on how satisfied customers are, so it is a good way for them to get ready for the normal mode.

This change should also address the requests for a harder game: testers have found the expert mode doable but more challenging than the normal one.

There is also another minor change: pirates can now add pineapple slices in their burgers (never tried it in real life, but I am sure it must be quite tasty if you are into sweet and sour flavors!)

I hope you like this update. If you haven't installed Burger Party already, [head over there][bp]!
