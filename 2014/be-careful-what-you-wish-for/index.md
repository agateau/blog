    On the perils of getting what you think is your dream job

> Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.

Sometimes history repeats itself. When I joined Canonical in 2009, I was excited about finally being able to "make a difference" by getting paid to contribute to free software I care about. It turns out that was not really the plan. I worked on many projects there, created components like libindicate-qt, dbusmenu-qt, appmenu-qt or sni-qt, but what I was working on was definitely not my call. And that actually made sense as I was hired by a company no work on *their* projects, not mine. I realized that a year later and decided to reduce my work time to [4 days a week](/2010/inflexion), leaving me with one day during which I would have the freedom to work on what mattered to me.

Fast forward to 2012: I join Blue Systems. This time it can't go wrong, I am going to work there as a KDE developer, I am finally going to be able to work on what really matters to me...

Not really.

While I definitely did contribute a lot more to KDE during my time there, I was never really able to pick what I would work on. I was hoping to work on what I care: KDE applications. Instead I mainly worked on Homerun, KF5 and Calamares, all interesting and (at least in the case of KF5) strategically useful for KDE as a whole, but not the topics I am really passionated about. To be honest I was given the opportunity to work on applications to some extent. I started the Extra mile initiative, but it did not gain traction and that is entirely my fault: I was not active enough to keep it alive. I also did get the chance to work a bit on KDEPIM, especially KMail. I got started with some minor fixes there and put together an ambitious plan for the next release, unfortunately, this plan was first [put on hold](/2013/frameworks-5-push), then definitely canned.

I probably sound like a whiner, but I am actually not complaining. I am a bit sad and frustrated that it evolved like that, but it was entirely predictable, had I kept my eyes and brain opened: Blue Systems, like Canonical, is a company, and *they* get to decide which projects their employees work on. Some times it matches what you care about, some times it does not.

Even if you are a better spin doctor than I am (I read [The Prince][prince], but that did not help :) ) and you manage to convince your company to let you work on what you think matters, it's not going to be all roses. If you get paid to work on a random project and the project maintainers are not interested in your changes or the way they are done, then you can either try to convince your company of going the way the maintainers suggest or in the worse case, fork the project. Now imagine you get paid to work on a project you are involved in outside of the company, but the changes your company asks you to implement do not match what you or the project maintainers (who might include you) would allow to get in. You now have a conflict of interest here: do you let the company influence decisions you take regarding this project you or do you refuse to compromise (and probably leave the company)?

I believe the only way to get paid to work on projects you are involved in without relinquishing control is if you are in control of how your project generates money: if the money you receive comes from your users, then you are in a better position to steer the project the way you think it should be. Unfortunately, that is easier said than done: for many projects it is not possible to generate such income.

In conclusion, if you get the opportunity to get hired to work on a project you already contribute to on your free time, consider the implications. Don't get carried away thinking you are going to keep the freedom to work on what you want. While you may be able to influence decisions, your employer will, rightfully, have the last word on what you are going to be paid for. Failure to recognize this can only lead to frustration.
