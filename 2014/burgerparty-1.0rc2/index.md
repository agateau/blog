Shortly after [1.0rc1](/2014/burgerparty-1.0rc1), here is Burger Party 1.0rc2. This version comes with the following changes:

- Fixed the annoying intermittent "can't add any item after an error" bug

- Adjusted proportions of character in "new world" cut scenes, they look more SD now

- Adjusted colors of pickles

- Added new sounds for soda and sundae, reassigned existing sounds to other ingredients

As you can see the list is quite short, which is a good thing: if everything goes well this version might be the one which goes public!
