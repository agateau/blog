title: "Yokadi 0.14.0"
summary: |
    After way too long, last week we released a new version of Yokadi.

You may not have heard about [Yokadi][]. It is a command-line based TODO list manager which I started some years ago and work on with a bunch of fellow contributors.

Yokadi is a side project for all of us, with occasional bursts of development activities when we find an itch to scratch or foolishly think we finally figured out *the* missing feature which is going to save us from procrastination :), therefore development is a bit slow. We usually run the latest version from the master branch, but not everybody is comfortable with such a way to work, so it is good to have releases. Version 0.13.0 was released 3 (three!) years ago, it was high time we got a new version out. Last week we finally released version 0.14.0.

If you are a command-line aficionado looking for a way to manage your tasks, Yokadi might be the tool you need. Head over to <http://yokadi.github.io> to learn more and get the latest version. We look forward to your feedback!
