<p>Thank you Aaron for the <a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2008/02/gwenview-falling-in-love-all-over-again.html">very nice post</a> about Gwenview. It's true that I, mere mortal, can't compete with your blogging rate :-). To answer one of the comments in Aaron post: In SVN, Gwenview does feature multiple undo/redo support. No need to fill a wishlist on b.k.o!</p>
