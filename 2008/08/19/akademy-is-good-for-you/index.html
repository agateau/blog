title: "Akademy is good for you!"

<p>At least it was good for me!</p>
<p>I have been working with KDE for a long time, first as a third-party application developer, then more closely when Gwenview made it into kdegraphics for KDE 4, but I never got the opportunity to attend Akademy. As a result, I was quite impatient to finally meet all the people I have been interacting with for a few years now.</p>
<p>While I only stayed for two days, I was lucky to be able to find most of the people I wanted to talk to. It started very early in fact, when I joined a bunch of developers having breakfast in the hostel before leaving to the event place. It was quite a unique sensation to walk in the breakfast room and being able to recognize lots of people I only knew from photos on blogs or event reports. Luckily I managed to refrain from doing silly things like asking autographs :-)</p>
<p>So in short, Akademy was a blast, and I hope to be able to attend next year!</p>
<p>PS: I would also like to join other attendees and say a big thank you to the organizers for their impressive work.</p>
