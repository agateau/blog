title: "Moved"

<p>In case you have been wondering why I was a bit silent these last weeks, it's because we moved to a new house. Leaving Maisons-Alfort for a nice village named La Chapelle Rablais. It's an important change in our life: going from a flat to a "real" house with a big garden!</p>
<p>Clara is delighted to have enough space to run, jump, or do whatever please her. I, for one, discover new activities, like lawn mowing or picking up dead leaves...</p>
<p>Of course, my daily commute is quite longer: going from two times half an hour to two times one hour and a half. It is not that bad however: my employer has agreed to let me spend my last hour of work in the train, so I wake up earlier but come home at approximately the same time as before. And I usually spend the morning trip working on Gwenview, which is a good news for most of you :).</p>
<p>I was left without an internet connection for a while, but it's back now, even if the status page of my ISP tells me it will be enabled in 20 days!</p>
