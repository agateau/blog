title: "Gwenview, Nepomuk and rating"

<p>Gwenview has always been file-system oriented, but with the advance of Nepomuk,
associating semantic information to your files is becoming more ubiquitous.</p>
<p>I started adding support for Nepomuk in Gwenview since KDE 4.1. It still needs
a lot of work, but it is becoming quite usable now. In this article I am going
to present how you can easily rate your images in Gwenview.</p>
<h2>Sidebar</h2>
<p>In the sidebar you can now see all Nepomuk information in the "Semantic
Information" group. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rating</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Tags (more on this in another article)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Browse mode</h2>
<p>In browse mode, there is clickable rating stars below each thumbnail, making it
convenient to quickly rate images.</p>

<h2>View mode</h2>
<p>View mode is still about showing your image with a minimum distraction, so
there is no always-present rating widget. You can rate images through the
menu, using Edit &gt; Rating, but it's much more convenient to use the shortcut
keys: Press keys 0 to 5 to associate a rating value. When you press these keys
a rating indicator is shown over the images for a few seconds:</p>
<a href="20081029-rating-view-mode.png"><img src="thumb_20081029-rating-view-mode.png" title="20081029-rating-view-mode" height="211" width="300" alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-88"/></a>
<p>This makes it fast and easy to rate images while browsing for keyboard friendly
users: go fullscreen, press a key between 0 and 5 to rate image, press Space to
go to the next one, repeat.</p>
<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>Rating images is interesting, but it is of marginal use unless you can filter
images to show only the highest rated ones. I am currently reworking the user
interface for this feature, but it is already possible to filter your folder:
in browse mode, click on the combobox in the bottom left of the window and
select "Filter by rating". Now click on the rating widget to only show images
with a rating greater or equal to the rating you want.</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Hopefully this will be available in KDE 4.2. Right now to give it a try you
need to build kdegraphics with the
<code>-DGWENVIEW_SEMANTICINFO_BACKEND=Nepomuk</code>
cmake option.</p>
