<p>I wrote a few KDE tips for a new French Linux magazine: <a href="http://www.ed-diamond.com/produit.php?produit=531">Linux Pratique Essentiel</a>. It's the first time I write for a magazine, thanks to Diamond Editions for asking me to collaborate to this!</p>
<p>I bought the magazine and it's quite good. It does a good job at presenting Linux software in a way "non-geek" users will appreciate.</p>
<p>It was also fun to find out that one of my ex coworkers, <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/">Dave Neary</a>, wrote a big part of the Gnome articles. So this magazine is (partially) brought to you by ex wengo-ers :)</p>
<strong>Update:</strong> I just received today a free copy of the magazine, thanks Diamond Editions!
