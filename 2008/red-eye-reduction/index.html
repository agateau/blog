title: "Red Eye Reduction"

<p>A feature I wanted to add for a long time to Gwenview has just landed in SVN:
red eye reduction.</p>
<p>It's (hopefully) simple to use. I made a screencast to demonstrate it:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/1818682?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="504" height="380" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
</p><p align="right"><a href="http://vimeo.com/download/video:85384220?e=1222441793&amp;h=ff5e429c201d8715dcb805db2b74ff89">Download original video.</a></p>
<p>The UI is quite inspired from iPhoto, I reused the widget style you can find in
the <a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/thumbnail-bars/">fullscreen bar</a>.</p>
<p>The current algorithm is a modified version of a <a href="http://getpaint.net">Paint.net</a> plugin. As you can see in the screencast, it does not try to be smart: you need to point the eyes yourself. Nevertheless, it does a good job at fixing the pupil color while keeping the iris untouched.
