title: "Zooming slider"

<p>By popular request, I moved the zooming actions to Gwenview status bar and introduced a zooming slider, as can be seen on this shot:
<div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="20080316-zoomslider.png" title="Gwenview with the new zooming slider" class=" image-reference"><img src="20080316-zoomslider.thumbnail.png" alt="Gwenview with the new zooming slider"/></a></div>
The nice thing about this change is that it removes quite a few buttons from the default toolbar. I am still not sure whether I like it or not, and would like to prettify the "zoom to fit" and "actual size" buttons. I think the button icons should be more distinct: the only difference between the current ones is a 5x5 pixel square.</p>
<p>I will probably play with it a bit more later. Maybe going as far as implementing the mockup mentionned in <a href="http://nowwhatthe.blogspot.com/2007/10/picture-viewers-widgets.html">this post</a> by Jos.</p>
