title: "I am going too!"

<p>I am very happy to announce it:</p>
<a href="http://akademy2008.kde.org"><img src="akademy2008.png" alt="" height="178" width="320"/></a>
<p>This will be my first Akademy, I am quite excited to finally be able to meet people I only know via email or irc.</p>
<p>I won't be there for the whole week, but you can expect me to be present on the12th and 13th. Since I made my decision to go quite late, I had to book an hostel on my own. I will be staying at the Holiday Inn Express, feel free to get in touch via email or by commenting if you stay there too.</p>
<p>I am also quite happy that my employer, <a href="http://www.os4i.com">Open Wide / OS4I</a>, is partly funding me, covering my travel expenses and giving me one day off to attend the "Embedded and Mobile Day".</p>
<p>See you in Mechelen!</p>
