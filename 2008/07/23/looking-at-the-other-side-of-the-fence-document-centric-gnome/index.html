title: "Looking at the other side of the fence, \"Document-centric GNOME\""

<p>Federico Mena Quintero, of GNOME fame, posted the presentation he gave this year at GUADEC: <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/news-2008-07.html#document-centric-gnome">Document-centric GNOME</a>. It's a fun presentation, full of interesting ideas. I especially like the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/docs/2008-GUADEC/html/img31.html">journal tab</a> he suggests. It looks like a nice candidate for a plasmoid.</p>
