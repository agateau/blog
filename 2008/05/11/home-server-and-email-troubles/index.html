title: "Home server (and email) troubles"

<p>I have been a happy user of a <a href="http://www.lex.com.tw:8080/product/NEO.htm">Lex Neo</a> fanless server for a few years until two weeks ago, when it froze. It produced a continuous beep when I tried to reboot it, symptom of memory problems. It accepted to boot on an old 64Mbyte stick, but would not start on anything bigger :(. I left it running in this state until today, when it definitely stopped...</p>
<p>This tiny machine has been serving various duties at home, ranging from git server, backup relay to the (excellent) <a href="http://rsync.net">rsync.net</a> service, file server, address book, note taker... and mail server, thanks to a combination of getmail, dovecot and spamassassin. This is where the story might affect you: Some of my email is trapped in the server for now, so you will have to wait even longer than usual for an answer from me.</p>
<p>I ordered a replacement one which should be there in the next week. Hopefully transition will be smooth and everything will be up and running quickly. Meanwhile I can answer new mail, so if you need a quicker answer, please send your mail again.</p>
