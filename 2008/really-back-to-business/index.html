title: "Really back to business"

<p>As a follow up to <a href="http://agateau.com/2008/03/12/slowly-coming-back-to-business/">a previous post</a>, I am happy to announce I now have a job again! I start working for <a href="http://www.openwide.fr">Open Wide</a> on next Monday, as a GUI developer in the <a href="http://www.os4i.com">OS4I</a> (Open Source For Industries) unit.</p>
<p>It feels good to get back to work, even if I didn't have too much problem keeping myself occupied with Gwenview :-)</p>
