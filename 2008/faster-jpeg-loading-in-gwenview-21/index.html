title: "Faster JPEG loading in Gwenview 2.1"

<p>I have been neglecting my communication duties with regard to Gwenview for a few weeks (who said "months"?). I have been busy coding instead, which is probably a good thing. Anyway, I will try to be a bit more chatty about changes happening in Gwenview.</p>
<p>Let's start with a change which should please large image shooters: <strong>Faster JPEG loading</strong>.</p>
<p>If you ask the upcoming Gwenview 2.1 to display a 4000x3000 JPEG image to fit in your 1280x800 screen, it divides dimensions by two and load a 2000x1500 version of the image. This is much faster and less memory intensive. For bigger images, it may divide the dimensions by 4 or even 8.</p>
<p>
I can hear some of you wondering, so let's try to address some of the questions you may have:
<dl>
<dt>Doesn't it look ugly?</dt>
<dd>
The result may look a little less sharper than if the full image has been loaded and scaled down, but my experience tend to prove this is only discernible when doing side by side comparisons.
</dd>
<dt>What happen when I zoom in?</dt>
<dd>
When you zoom in to the point where the reduced image is not big enough anymore, Gwenview will load a bigger version of it. If you were looking at a image reduced by 4, it will load an image reduced by 2, or the full image if it's not enough.
</dd>
<dt>What happen when I make changes to the image and save it?</dt>
<dd>
Whenever you make changes to the image, Gwenview loads the full image, so that it can save the changes.
</dd></dl></p>
<dt>Does it work with all images?</dt>
<dd>No, for the moment only JPEG images can benefit from this. It should be possible to implement this for other formats though.</dd>

<h2>Implementation details</h2>
This system has been implemented using Qt facilities to load scaled down images, namely <code>QImageReader::setScaledSize()</code>. I had to wrote my own version of the JPEG decoder though, because Qt decoder was not aggressive enough in scaling down images.
<p>I wrote a little bench program to compare both decoders. Give it a JPEG and it loads a scaled down version of it, two times, using both decoders. The target size is 1280x800. Here is some bench output:
</p><pre>./imageloadbench landscape-picture-2816x2112.jpg
Using Qt loader
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
time: 2615
Using Gwenview loader
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
time: 1092

./imageloadbench large-panoramic-image-21121x366.jpg
Using Qt loader
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
time: 24699
Using Gwenview loader
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
time: 4424</pre><p>
As you can see, it's more than two times faster on not-so-big images, and gets even more efficient on very large ones.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this bench program, you can find it in <a href="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdegraphics/gwenview/tests/imageloadbench.cpp?revision=HEAD&amp;view=markup">kdegraphics/gwenview/tests/imageloadbench.cpp</a>. You have to run <code>make imageloadbench</code> to build it.</p>
