title: "Gwenview 1.4 status"

<p>Since my hack time is quite limited, when I started to work on the KDE4 version of Gwenview I decided Gwenview 1.4 (the KDE3 version) would not get improved. Nevertheless, there has been a few fixes here and there, for example to ensure Gwenview 1.4 plays nicely with latest versions of the Exiv2 library (<a href="http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167420">bug 167420</a>).</p>
<p>Some translators are also active: I just applied a Russian translation update from Yaroslav Popovitch.</p>
<p>I do not plan to create new tarballs for now, so if you are interested in those updates, be sure to grab the code from the <a href="http://websvn.kde.org/branches/extragear/kde3/graphics/">extragear-kde3 branch</a>.</p>
