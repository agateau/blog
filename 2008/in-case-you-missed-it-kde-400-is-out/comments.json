I will be patient now :) Also, one thing I noticed was missing was it doesn't tell you how many files are in a specific folder and what picture you are on, ie 15 of 100. I know when it's ready it will be in there. Just something else I noticed missing. Great job on the program so far.</p>","replies":[]}]
