Gwenview rocks.</p><p>Just one minor niggle about the fullscreen view.  The thumbnails looks great, but the left side of the bar looks a little cluttered.  After all one of the reasons for a fullscreen is to concentrate on the picture and remove other UI clutter.</p><p>Some ideas to simplify:<br>- Remove the extension from the image name.  It is not important to know whether the current picture is a jpg or png in fullscreen mode.<br>- Remove either the time or both the time and date.  Right now at a glance it just looks like a string of random numbers which adds clutter.  Fullscreen mode if for viewing pictures, not for detailed analysis.  This information could be put into a tooltip instead as a compromise.<br>- I don't know what the wrench icon does, but I assume some sort of settings.  Without knowing what's in those settings I won't complain, but perhaps the fullscreen mode shouldn't need dedicated settings.  Or at least not an icon for them.<br>- The combo box for time delay is not needed.  Either that can be adjusted in the settings (from the wrench icon if you want to keep it), or it can be adjusted in the global gwenview settings.  It definitely doesn't need to be constantly visible.</p><p>Fullscreen view is not another application, it should be a very simple view.</p><p>These are just well-meaning suggestions though.

Making it symmetrical adds a lot to the aesthetic.  I like the buttons on the side too.  The only question is, if it is a wide picture that goes to the screen edge, where do the buttons go?

I was never really happy with the preview mode.  I obviously have not tried it, but this replacement looks nearly ideal to me.</p><p>Two questions, is there (or will there be) an option to place the bar on the side?  Having it on the bottom is good for normal monitors, but having it on the side is much better for wide-screen monitors.</p><p>Second, is there or will there be an option resize the thumbnails?  The one benefit I can see of the preview panel is that it has its own size slider for quickly and easily resizing the previews.  I don't see that here.  On the other hand, if you are able to drag the edge of the thumbnail bar to resize it, and have all thumbnails all grow or shrink accordingly, that would be easier still.  However it is not obvious from the picture whether that is possible or not.  In Gwenview and Dolphin, and probably other programs as well, there is a thin but distinctive bar with dots where resizing is possible.  I don't see that.</p><p>@ David: I actually like the placement of the button.  Three reasons.  First, it is not a view, but a bar.  I think it is useful to keep them separate.  Second, the button is closer to where the bar will appear, which I think is probably better ergonomics.  Third, it is possible (if not likely) that other bars may appear later.  For instance I know that some people want PhotoFlow implemented in Gwenview, and if that ever happens (a big if, I know) it could be placed as a button next to the thumbnail button.  Still other views could be implemented in the same manner.</p><p>@ Tim:  As long as you have KDE 4 libraries and necessary kparts are installed, it is my understanding you should be able to use the apps in Gnome.  I sincerely doubt that a version that is independent of KDE libs is forthcoming, since I am pretty sure Gwenview depends very heavily on KDE 4.</p>","replies":[]},{"id":"dsq-457709754","author":"Markus Mauder","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2008-03-30T22:27:53Z","message":"<p>Hi Aur√©lien!</p><p>I just built gwenview to see how the fullscreen view feels.

I will probably replace it with a slider. Should look much better, but I need to think about a place to place it.<br>If you insist that it is a frequent enough action to warrant a user interface element on the toolbar a slider may be the way to go. I tried putting it in the same menu bar as the settings button and that didn't look too out of place. That was with the navigation elements inside a different toolbar though.</p><p>&gt; - All those interface panes will come up from the borders as you move the mouse, this is going to be quite invading.<br>Yup, I tried it now and I agree. Maybe fading would be less invading, but the proper solution is probably to move the next/previous buttons somewhere else.<br>I still don't like them up there with the rest of the interface. I can't put my finger on it, but I think it has something to do with the fact that I expect to click on them a lot more often than the others.</p><p>&gt; - Position of the previous and next buttons makes it difficult to move back and forth as you have to travel the whole screen to go from one button to the other. <br>I thought of this, but decided to put them there anyway, because I was hoping the next -&gt; prev -&gt; next order of steps would be infrequent. Of course it happens and it is annoying to have to move 1600 pixels to get there. So lets leave them next to each other.</p><p>I tried a few ideas, but couldn't come up with a way to add another bar to the bottom of the screen.

I added the new toolbar to a new row in the grid layout so I could get a better idea of how it would feel. Takes away a lot of space obviously, but helps with the crowdedness. An extra slider taking up space in the main toolbar might make it worth while though.<br>- avoid having to move the mouse too far by putting the prev/next buttons next to each other.<br>If a second toolbar would be ok with you I would put them on there together with the thumbnail bar.<br>- Larger play button, small configure button and interval slider next to it.<br>We talked about the configure button. If moving it to the configure menu is out of the question, the interval widget might fit here.<br>- separation of slide show and fullscreen related actions by moving fullscreen to the other side of the screen.<br>The right side of the screen also happens to be where the close button is in the default setup. Just something that occured to me, maybe it helps usability.</p><p>I am not sure about the extra toolbar, which became a quite integral part of this new concept.
