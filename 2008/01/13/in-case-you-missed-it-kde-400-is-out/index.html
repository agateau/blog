title: "In case you missed it, KDE 4.0.0 is out!"

<p>So it's here, KDE 4.0.0 is out. This release has a special meaning for me: it's the first one to include Gwenview in the kdegraphics module. This means it's also the first time a new version of Gwenview is released without me building and uploading tarballs and announcing them on various sites, thanks to the KDE release team.</p>
<p>I can feel KDE 4.0.0 is out by looking at my Bugzilla mail folder... the number of unread messages is growing, time to do some bug triage.</p>
