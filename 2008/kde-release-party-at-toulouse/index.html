title: "KDE Release party at Toulouse"

<p>KDE Release party at Toulouse was great! It was a pleasure to meet again with David Faure, Laurent Montel and Anne-Marie Mahfouf as well as meeting K&#233;vin Ottens and Alexis M&#233;nard for the first time. Kudos to K&#233;vin and Alexis for the organisation of the event, and much thanks to Alexis for hosting Laurent and me for the night.</p>
<p>On friday evening, a nice, professional, presentation of KDE 4.0 were given by K&#233;vin before everybody raided the buffet :-). The day after we held technical presentations on various aspects of Qt and KDE programming. I gave a presentation on Qt stylesheets, which went well. I am quite happy about it, especially since I prepared it using an extreme-just-in-time-almost-too-late presentation creation method, as can be seen <a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_oe3nsyc4kd0/R5yk85IyzCI/AAAAAAAAAE4/k3u8NwzFgGM/s1600-h/100_3195.jpg">on this picture</a> (yes, I am the one with the laptop...)</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I am on the KDE stand at <a href="http://www.solutionslinux.fr/en/index.php">Solutions Linux 2008</a>, an annual french exhibition held in Paris. It seems I am currently in public relation mode :-).</p>
<p>I am getting ready for the FAQ, which I guess will be:
<ol>
<li>What's new in KDE4?</li>
<li>Why did you release it if it's not finished?</li>
</ol>
If you want to suggest interesting answers to these questions (especially #1), please do so in the comments.</p>
