title: Inktober 2019, cats!

I participated again to [Inktober][], the yearly challenge where you draw and ink one drawing a day each day of October. The Inktober web site provides a "prompt list": a list of words for each day, which you can (but are not forced to) follow.

I followed it as it helps me come up with drawing ideas, and I also picked "cats" as a recurring theme, so all my drawings are filled with kittens. This makes them very Internet friendly, since as we all know, the Internet was created to share cat pictures, right?

I went full color this year, since I now have a decent set of markers:

I am not sure I will do it this way next year though: making full colored drawings everyday takes a lot of time. I am proud that I did it this year, but I am also relieved October is over :)

Here are my drawings of this year:
