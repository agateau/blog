title: Nanonote 1.0.1

The [first release][v100] of [Nanonote][], my minimalist note-taking app, was a bit rushed: I broke indentation shortly before tagging version 1.0.0... meh.

[v100]: ../../2018/nanonote-1-0-0

So here is version 1.0.1. It fixes the indentation and adds the ability to indent or unindent whole lines with Tab and Shift+Tab, in addition to the existing Ctrl+I and Ctrl+U shortcuts.

<!-- break -->

In addition to these changes, the build system can now generate Debian and RPM packages, making the application easier to install.

These packages are generated by CPack inside an Ubuntu 18.04 Docker. This means they work on my machine, but do not have the same level of quality as packages crafted by real packagers. I am especially looking for feedback regarding the RPM packages, which I haven't tested.

You can find them on the [project release page][release].

There aren't any other end-user changes in this release but I worked on infrastructure a bit: I added unit tests and set up Travis CI for continuous integration. I am probably going to write an article about this next. In the mean time, enjoy Nanonote 1.0.1!
