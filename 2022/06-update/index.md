title: June 2022 monthly update

## Introduction

Another super-late monthly update. I feel like I should start the next one tomorrow to get a chance to publish it on time :)

## Pixel Wheels

Not much has happened in June on Pixel Wheels, I merged in updates for the Basque and Russian translations, and updated my French translation.

Beside this, I fixed the "Open log folder button does not work on Windows" bug, getting ready for Pixel Wheels 0.23.0 release (which has already happened at the time I am writing this, but it's for July report...)

## New project! Clyde

Why did I do so little on Pixel Wheels? Well... I am afraid I started yet-another project! Let me introduce you to Clyde.

Clyde is a "package manager for prebuilt applications". For the last few years we have seen more and more applications being made available as static binaries. Those binaries are easy to install, but it's tedious to keep them up-to-date. Clyde aims at fixing this. Instead of installing binaries by hand, you `clyde install` them (assuming Clyde knows about them...)

Clyde brings a few other advantages compared to installing by hand: it can verify the integrity of downloaded packages and provide better integration, for example by making any man page provided by the application available.

Clyde supports Linux, macOS and Windows.

To learn more, visit [Clyde project page](https://github.com/agateau/clyde). Be warned though, it's still at a very early stage!

## What's next?

Next month I plan to resume the work on tires I shelved for Pixel Wheels 0.23.0. I also expect to continue working on Clyde, we'll see where this new project goes...
