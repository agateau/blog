summary: Green Yeti Lab site has been redesigned.


Long time no post! I have been pretty busy with a job change, but I am now getting used to my new routine, hacking on Tiny Wheels in the train on my way to work. I spent some (a bit too much!) time working on a redesign for the site because I was getting fed up with the old one. I wanted something a bit more playful and punchy. Hope you like it!

I have also been working a lot on Tiny Wheels, I want to finish a few things and upload a new preview version, with cool new features like being able to pick your own vehicle, a new map, or a 2-player split-screen mode for the desktop version! Stay tuned!
