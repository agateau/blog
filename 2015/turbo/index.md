summary: "Working on a new bonus for Tiny Wheels: the turbo."


This week I have been working on a new bonus for Tiny Wheels: the turbo. When you pick it up, two bottles of green liquid get strapped on top of your vehicle (Some N<sub>2</sub>O probably. Is N<sub>2</sub>O green? I have no idea). Triggering it gives you a significant boost, and a small flame appears behind you, because you are driving faaaast!

I am still working on it, but it's almost done. I also reworked the turbo road tiles to use the same code, as the turbo bonus gives you better control on your vehicle than the road tiles used to.
