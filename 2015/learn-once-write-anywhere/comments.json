The cool thing about it and what makes it different from the various other 'components for the web' effort is all the possibilities that come out of the functional style where components are essentially functions that take state/properties as input and return a virtual UI tree as output (ie. \"renderUI(state, props) -&gt; UI\").</p><p>As far as cross-platform UI goes, it'll be interesting to see where it ends up. Every approach on the \"fully native\" to \"fully web\" spectrum has trade-offs. React/QML are just extra options that sit somewhere along the spectrum.</p>","replies":[]}]
