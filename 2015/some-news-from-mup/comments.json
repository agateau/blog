Well I am fine with markdown for now ;). It was just an idea for having a broader input range. Now that I looked more closely at the github repo I realized you mention Pandoc there, looks like I missed it before.</p><p>Regarding Okular, guess it then would require using QtWebkit to render an image with links and feed that to Okular.
