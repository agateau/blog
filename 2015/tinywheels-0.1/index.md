summary: Finally a release of Tiny Wheels! It's still a very early alpha but I hope you enjoy it nevertheless.


Time for a new release!

I have been very busy with work lately, having changed job, not working from home anymore... I am getting used to my new routine and take advantage of my daily commute to hack on Tiny Wheels.

Even if it's still a very early alpha, it was high time to get a new version out. It's been so long since the last one I am probably going to miss quite a few changes. Anyway, from the top of my head, here is what's new:

- A new map
- New pixel-art graphics
- Selectable vehicles
- Adjusted vehicle physics (still not happy with them, but it's getting better)
- Slightly less dumb AI (where less dumb actually means better waypoints so they get stuck less often)

The desktop version also has a special feature: a split-screen two player mode.
