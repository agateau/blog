title: "\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Festival!\""

<p>I don't think I ever mentioned it here, but one of my brothers is also known as Nicky DMC, a member of "<a href="http://myspace.com/bawdyfestival/">Bawdy Festival</a>", a crazy music band. They are dressed as evil clowns and play a unique mix of metal and hip-hop they call clown-core. Inspiration comes from Cypress Hill, Insane Clown Posse, Tim Burton movies and a few other sources. Oh, and their shows are amazing!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to see them perform in a small venue. There were three bands playing and Bawdy Festival was scheduled to be the second band to play. When they arrived on stage, the public immediatly grew really massive, it seems they have quite a few fans nowadays. They delivered a great show, I especially enjoyed when the band enjoined the public to "pogo-valse" (imagine a mix of pogo and waltz!).</p>
<p>Lots of people moved on to the merchandise booth afterwards and the third band did not experience the same level of attention (felt a bit sorry for them). I helped handling the booth (it seems I am a lot into <a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/kde-at-solutions-linux-2010/">holding booths</a> these days!): selling posters, t-shirts and dog-tags while the band members were busy dedicating concert tickets, posters, arms(!)...</p>
<p>All in all it was a great evening, unfortunately I did not bring my camera with me, but I'll leave you with a video of Boogalion Mafia, one of their latest songs:</p>
