Plasma notifications seem so out of place, these days, within the Plasma desktop clashing with all its transparency and, now, its blur effect, and with its smooth effects (graphical effects, thumbnails transitions, etc). Is there any chance Colibri gets an active notification system to cover such functionalities as progress information and buttons integration?</p><p>Also, any plans to provide a PPA in order to use always the latest version available, please?
