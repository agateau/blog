title: "Home made Mölkky!"

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/back-from-akademy-2010/">article about Akademy</a>, I discovered a fun Finnish game named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molkky">M&#246;lkky</a> and decided to build a set for the family. Following instructions from <a href="http://lebatonmouche.fr/1_Le_molkky/molkky_acquerir.htm">this page (fr)</a>, I bought a wooden garden stake and built a game of M&#246;lkky with Clara today, here it is, note the "beautiful" typography :):</p>

<p>She was quite proud to help me saw the wooden stake. We played our first game this afternoon. It was really nice to see she enjoyed it, I only had to bent the rules a bit by allowing her to throw the M&#246;lkky from a closer place and to retry her throw once when she missed. All in all good fun for a cheap investment :)</p>
