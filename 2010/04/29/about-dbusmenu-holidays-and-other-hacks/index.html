title: "About DBusMenu, holidays, and other hacks..."

<p>Due to some bad reading of KDE SC 4.5 release schedule (I thought dependency freeze was on April, 26th, when it has been postponed to May, 11th), I committed support for DBusMenu to kdelibs on Sunday (25th) evening, right before taking a week off for holidays...</p>
<p>Suffice it to say it was not a really good timing. While the code has been in reviewboard for some time, it missed at least a proper one-week announcement, a separate post to the build system mailing-list and a developer who is not on vacation to quickly sort out issues. Thanks to those who pointed out my mistakes. One learns everyday, I shall remember this when I need to add another dependency to kdelibs.</p>
<p>If you are curious about DBusMenu, you can read my <a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2009/12/24/statusnotifieritem-and-dbusmenu/">previous post about it</a>. Additionally, I will be giving a talk about it at Akademy 2010.</p>
<p>While on holidays, apart from babysitting my 7 month-old and fixing various stuff in the house, I found some time to work a bit on Gwenview, with the focus on getting rid of most, if not all, places where the UI could freeze because of a lengthy task. It's not in svn yet, but should be soon. You probably won't find a lot of changes in Gwenview 2.5, but you should at least get a more responsive interface.</p>
