title: "Looking for maintainers for a few KIPI plugins"

<p>&#65279;&#65279;For the past few months I haven't been able to find enough time and motivation to work on the two KIPI plugins I am supposed to maintain: HTML Export and Batch Image Processing.</p>
<p>I think it's time for me to acknowledge that I am doing a disservice to users by lagging on bug reports and being practically inactive. This probably come from the fact that I do not have a personal need for these plugins, so it would be better for them to find maintainers who really care about them.</p>
<p>In case you don't know about it, <a href="http://www.kipi-plugins.org/">KIPI</a> stands for KDE Image Plugin Interface. It is a library which makes it possible to share plugins between imaging applications. As far as I know, KIPI plugins are used by digiKam, KPhotoAlbum and Gwenview.</p>
<p>Right now most KIPI plugin developers are also digiKam developers, which is the reason it took me so long to decide giving up on the plugins I (am supposed to) maintain: it did not feel fair to let digiKam developers indirectly work for Gwenview without giving something back to digiKam. </p>
<p>The "Batch Image Processing" and "Raw converter" plugins (also in need of a maintainer) are going to be disabled in the next version of digiKam because digiKam is going to provide more tighly integrated implementations of these tools (see Gilles post about <a href="http://www.digikam.org/drupal/node/427">Batch Queue Manager</a>). This is why it is very important to get new developers involved: no one can expect digiKam developers to maintain plugins which are not available in their application.</p>
<p>KIPI plugins are usually small code bases, which can be relatively easy to grasp for a newcomer. Working on a KIPI plugin is also a great way to contribute to several applications at a time! Of course I intend to help new maintainers getting used to the code bases as much as I can. If you are interested, join the <a href="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-imaging">kde-imaging</a> mailing list and get started!</p>
