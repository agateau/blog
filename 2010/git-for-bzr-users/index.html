title: "Git for Bzr users"

<p>Since KDE is switching to git and some Kubuntu members have started to be worried about this switch as they mostly know bzr, I registered a session for Ubuntu Developer Summit named "Git for Bzr users".</p>
<p>It was scheduled for this morning and I was a bit afraid it would turn into a troll session between git and bzr zealots. Luckily it went very well, a few bzr developers attended the session and there were interesting conversations between them and other more git-savvy attendees (I am happy my evil plan to learn bzr equivalents of my preferred git features worked out perfectly :)).</p>
<p>In case you are interested, the slides are <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~agateau/git-for-bzr-users/">on my Canonical people page</a>.</p>
