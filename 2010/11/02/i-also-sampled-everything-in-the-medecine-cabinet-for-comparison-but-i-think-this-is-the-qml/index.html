title: "\"I also sampled everything in the medecine cabinet for comparison, but I think this is the QML\""

<p>I came back from Ubuntu Developer Summit, completely exhausted as usual. A tradition in UDS is that during the midday plenary sessions on Friday, people can do 5 minutes lightning talks. On Thrusday I was asked to do a lightning talk on QML. Since I only started playing with QML three days ago, it sounded like an interesting challenge!</p>
<p>I sat down in front of my laptop on Thursday evening to put together two short QML demos, trying to show off QML was made of awesome and fully bling-compliant. The talk was a bit rocky (if you have never seen a laptop suspending due to an empty battery during a 5 minute talk, you missed something!) but I somehow managed to demonstrate everything I planned to show. In the end I think the talk was well received despite that technical oups.</p>
<p>Since I discovered qmlviewer is able to record while playing, I made videos of the demos:</p>

<p>You can also run the demos on your machine. Get the source code with <code>bzr clone lp:~agateau/+junk/uds-qml-demo</code> and <code>bzr clone lp:~agateau/+junk/uds-qml-demo2</code> and start them with <code>qmlviewer uds-qml-demo.qml</code>. No need to compile anything, it's only qml and javascript!</p>
<p>Keep in mind I am still new to this declarative way of thinking and the code is a one evening hack, so it may not be the best way to learn about this new technology.</p>
<p>PS: In case you are wondering what the title of this post means, <a href="http://xkcd.com/353/">here is a hint</a> :).</p>
