title: "November 2010 wrap-up"

<p>About one month ago I announced <a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/inflexion/">I would be reducing my working days to four</a> in order to spend more time on the projects which interested me. I explained I would be asking for donations in order to compensate part of the income reduction. A common request I received from people who seemed to be interested in donating was to know what I would be working on. This makes sense to me: you want to know what you pay for. Therefore I decided to start a monthly wrap-up post, summarizing what I did in the last month and announcing what I plan to do in the next one. Note that I reserve the right to do something different from what I announced if I find something more interesting/important or if I simply run out of time. I will however try to stick with what I announced as much as possible. Think of these announcements as "development forecasts"...</p>
<p>Here is what I did in November:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some work on Gwenview:
  <ul>
<li><a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/easily-share-images-with-gwenview/">Implemented a "share" button</a></li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=251946">bug #251946</a> "Crash on close"</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236577">bug #236577</a> "Using two time save as, overwrites original file". That one was really nasty. The fix has been backported to 4.5.</li>
<li>Fixed wrong name in sidebar after save as</li>
<li>Brought back the "rating indicator": a tiny overlay displayed over the image when you adjust its rate in view mode and the sidebar is hidden. Quite handy in full-screen mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consistency cleanup: ensure applications which provide menu items to show/hide UI elements always use checkable items and do not alter the text (ie: when checking the  "Show Foo" item, do not turn its text into "Hide Foo"):
  <ul>
<li>Fixed text of checkable menu items getting altered in Konqueror, KNode, Umbrello and KUser</li>
<li>Fixed KLettres and KMag to use generic kdelibs code to toggle menubars and toolbars instead of their own implementation (less code, more consistency and no show/hide text problem)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2010/11/26/obsessed-with-details-file-dialog-audio-preview/">Reworked the audio preview in the file dialog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What I plan for December:
<ul>
<li>Continue bug fixing in Gwenview</li>
<li>Some UI polish on kdepim (Even if it is going to be a bit limited because we passed string freeze for KDE SC 4.6)</li>
<li>Fix blurriness of the progress pie-chart in the networkmanagement Plasma applet</li>
<li>Start a series of blog posts about common UI mistakes in KDE applications</li>
</ul></p>
