title: "A week in Portland, Oregon"

<p>I spent the first week of February in Portland, where I attended Canonical Platform Sprint for Ubuntu Lucid. We got some good work done on the DBusMenu front. You can read about it on <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/2010/02/10/kde-application-indicators-in-gnome/">Jono</a> and <a href="http://castrojo.wordpress.com/2010/02/06/application-indicator-update/">Jorge</a> blog posts.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by this town and really enjoyed it. It is very different from Dallas where I went for Ubuntu Developer Summit: Buildings are not too tall, they have very good public transportation ($2.30 for a two hour tramway ticket!) and they are quite active at recycling.</p>
<p>What pleased me even more is that the town has a strong Japanese influence. I should have expected this, with it being on the west coast and one of her sister cities being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapporo">Sapporo</a>, the 5th largest city of Japan. Almost every restaurant we went to had Nigiri, Maki, or Sashimi in their menu. I especially enjoyed the restaurant of the Paramount Hotel, which featured creative rolls with funny names like the Evil Tha&#239; Roll or even the Ninja Turtle Roll! I ended up with a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/12502017@N08/4360200009/in/set-72157623318236795/">Catterpillar Roll</a>, which was really good.</p>
<p>We also went to <a href="http://groundkontrol.com/">Ground Kontrol</a>, a cool bar featuring classic arcade cabinets and chip tune music... It was nice to play Raiden 2, 720&#176;, Marvel vs Capcom 2, 1943, House of the Dead or being lectured on Championship Sprint by my manager :). I heartily recommend this place!</p>
<p>I took a few pictures, you can find the semi decent ones <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/12502017@N08/sets/72157623318236795/">on Flickr</a>. I only carried a small Sanyo Xacti CA6: its compact size makes it quite handy (I like to travel with only a single carry-on bag whenever possible), but it is not a very good still camera, especially with its hard-to-press shoot button, which makes it difficult to keep the orientation correct. I have an old Nikon Z3 at home, which is nicer but a bit bulkier, so I may buy a small camera for my next trip. Any model you would recommend?</p>
