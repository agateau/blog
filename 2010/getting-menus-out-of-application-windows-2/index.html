title: "Getting menubars out of application windows, episode II... the missing screencast"

<p>As promised in my first post about <a href="http://agateau.com/2010/05/10/getting-menus-out-of-application-windows/">getting menubars out of application windows</a>, here is the missing screencast: application menus in KDE, with GTK+ support.</p>

<p>There is still work to do, in particular getting GTK+ menus correctly ordered. I need to investigate whether the problem is in Plasma import or in the GTK+ export steps. Things are moving quite well though: icons and shortcuts are back, quite a few bugs got fixed and we have the beginning of a fallback menu (the menu which is shown when a menubar-less window is active, or when no window are active)</p>
<p>Ubuntu Lucid users can try this using the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~canonical-dx-team/+archive/une">Unity PPA</a>. If you want to build it yourself, you will need:
<ul>
<li>The Qt patch, which you can find in the appmenu branch <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/~agateau/qt/agateau-qt/commits/appmenu">of my Gitorious fork of Qt</a></li>
<li>DBusMenuQt: <a href="https://launchpad.net/libdbusmenu-qt">https://launchpad.net/libdbusmenu-qt</a></li>
<li>The Plasma menubar widget: <a href="https://launchpad.net/plasma-widget-menubar">https://launchpad.net/plasma-widget-menubar</a></li>
</ul></p>
