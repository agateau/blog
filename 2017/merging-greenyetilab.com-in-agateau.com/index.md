summary: "Two sites to maintain is one too many, greenyetilab.com got merged into agateau.com."

A few years ago I started Green Yeti Lab, I envisioned it would become a game and app studio, able to produce at least part of my income while I was doing consulting. Since this was not necessarily free-software related I decided to create a separate site for it. It did not work out as expected: my first game did not generate any significant revenue, and I was starting to feel miserable with my current consulting client. I met [Genymobile][] during a conference, and managed to land a job as a Qt developer there, ending my independent developer plus consultant attempt.

In my free time, I continued working on my next game: [Tiny Wheels][tw] and updating Green Yeti Lab site, but it eventually stalled. Tiny Wheels did not receive any update for 2 years, as I switched to work on [Yokadi][]. That was getting me frustrated, so this summer I started to work on the game again.

I also decided having one site for mobile development and another for all the rest does not make much sense. I'd rather have a single place where I can write, whether it's about game or app development, drawing or whatever I feel like ranting about. Therefore I am merging greenyetilab.com into agateau.com.

The project pages for [Burger Party][bp] and [Tiny Wheels][tw] have been imported, as well as all the [blog posts][gyl-posts]. Most of them only have historical value, but a few might be of interest for you:

- [Introducing Linguaj](/2014/linguaj): An Apache 2 licensed, gettext library for Android applications;
- [Subtle difference between Duplicate and Copy'n'Paste](/2014/subtle-difference-between-duplicate-and-copy-n-paste): In Inkscape, "Duplicate" is not the same as "Copy and Paste";
- [Who's first?](/2015/who-s-first): How to compute the race order of cars in a top-down car game.

Now that this is done, I can go back to work on Tiny Wheels!
