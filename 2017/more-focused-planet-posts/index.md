    Changing the way this blog posts are aggregated on Planet KDE and Planet Ubuntu.

My blog has been syndicated on [Planet KDE][pko] and [Planet Ubuntu][puc] for a long time, but sometimes topics I want to write about are not really relevant for these aggregators, so either I write them anyway and end up feeling a bit guilty for spamming, or I refrain from writing at all.

[pko]: http://planet.kde.org
[puc]: http://planet.ubuntu.com

Today I decided to change the feeds used to syndicate this blog on both aggregators. Planet Ubuntu will receive mainly free software related posts and Planet KDE mainly Qt or KDE related posts.

I plan to write on more diverse topics now that I know I won't be pushing off-topic content to the Planets anymore. If you want to get all my posts, subscribe to the [full feed](/feed) or follow me on [Twitter][].
