title: More focused Planet KDE posts
summary: |
    Changing the way this blog posts are aggregated on Planet KDE.

My blog has been syndicated on [Planet KDE][pko] and [Planet Ubuntu][puc] for a long time, but sometimes topics I want to write about are not really relevant to these aggregators, so I either refrain from writing, or write anyway and end up feeling a bit guilty for spamming.

[pko]: http://planet.kde.org
[puc]: http://planet.ubuntu.com

I decided to make some changes to fix that. I got my blog removed from Planet Ubuntu since I am no longer an Ubuntu member. I then pointed Planet KDE aggregator to a specific feed so that I can decide which posts end up on there. This will ensure Planet KDE receives mostly Qt or KDE related posts from me, even if I still sneak in a random post from time to time.

I plan to write on more diverse topics now that I know I won't be pushing off-topic content to Planet KDE anymore. If you want to get all my posts, subscribe to the [full feed](/feed) or follow me on [Twitter][].
