summary: Doxyqml makes it possible to use Doxygen to document QML files

Doxyqml is an input filter for [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org), a documentation system for C++ and a few other languages.

Doxyqml makes it possible to use Doxygen to document QML code.

I created this tool and maintained it until 2020, then handed over maintenance to the KDE SDK team. Its new home is: <https://invent.kde.org/sdk/doxyqml/>.
