I have many projects. Below is an incomplete list of them. You can find
other goodies on my [GitHub page](http://github.com/agateau).

## Applications

### [MUP](http://github.com/agateau/mup)

An extensible markup previewer, capable of showing texts written in multiple markup languages.

### [Equiv](http://github.com/agateau/equiv)

An Android application to track your protein consumption. Primarily designed to help people affected by Phenylketonuria.

### [Gwenview](http://user.kde.org/Gwenview)

An image viewer for KDE. It is the default image viewer since KDE 4.0. After
maintaining it for 14 years, I passed maintainership To Lukas Tinkl.

### [KidMP](/projects/kidmp)

A kid-friendly media player.

### [QSR](/projects/qsr/)

A graphical search and replace utility.

### [Colibri](/projects/colibri/)

An alternative to KDE Plasma 4 notifications. I am reasonably happy with Plasma
5 notifications, so I don't have plans to port Colibri to Plasma 5 for now.

## Command line tools

### [Yokadi](http://yokadi.github.com)

A command-line-based, sqlite-powered TODO list.

### [Doxyqml](/projects/doxyqml/)

A Doxygen input filter to document QML files.

## Games

### [Burger Party](http://greenyetilab.com/burgerparty)

An Android game where you must prepare burgers fast enough to keep your customers happy.

### [Plouf!](/projects/plouf/)

A top-down Amiga game I wrote when I was a teenager. It features 2 or 3 players
sittings on floats, in the sea, trying to sink each others by throwing sea
urchins.
