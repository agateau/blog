KidMP is a kid-friendly media player.

KidMP is a media player primarily designed for kids. This application can be
used while travelling to replace a portable DVD player.

It has been designed to work well on a laptop in an environment where using the
touchpad is difficult (think of a 5 year-old holding the laptop on his laps in
the car). As such it is primarily keyboard-based.

Features which make KidMP a kid-friendly player:

- Large, customizable thumbnails
- No need to be able to read
- Fully usable with only 3 keys: left arrow, right arrow and space (or return)
- Automatically resume playing at last position
- Start in fullscreen by default, difficult to quit by accident
