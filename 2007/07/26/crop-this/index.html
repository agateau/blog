title: "Crop this!"

<p>I have been working on adding crop support to Gwenview these days. It's still quite rough, but I am pleased with how it came out. Here is the mandatory screenshot:</p>

</p><p>As I said, it's still rough, and I plan to improve a few things, like moving the dialog content to the side bar for example or making it possible to drag the crop rectangle by grabbing it in the middle.</p>
