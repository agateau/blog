title: "Windows, svn+ssh and the Subversion command line client"

<p>This morning, I needed to access an svn+ssh Subversion repository from a Windows box. Since I am a command line aficionado, I decided to do it using the Subversion command line client. It turned out to be quite more complicated than I thought... So here is how I did it :</p>
<p>Download plink.exe and puttygen.exe from <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty website</a>.</p>
<p>Next step is to generate an SSH key and place it on your server.
<ul>
<li>Start puttygen and generate a private key.</li>
<li>Save it.</li>
<li>In the upper part of the window, there is a text field labeled "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file:". Log on your server and append the content of this text field to the <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file (create it if it does not exist).<em>
The content of this text field is different from what you would get with the "Save public key" button.<strong> </strong>Do not try to copy this generated public key. It won't work.</em></li>
<li>Check if it works: try to login on the server with plink:
</li></ul></p><pre>plink -i c:pathtoyourkey.ppk user@server</pre><p>
If everything goes well, you should get logged in without getting asked for your password.

Now you need to configure Subversion to use plink for "svn+ssh" uri.
<ul>
<li>Edit the file <code>c:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\Subversion\config</code></li>
<li>Locate the section named <code>[tunnels]</code></li>
<li>Add the following line :
</li></ul></p><pre>ssh=c:/path/to/plink.exe -i c:/path/to/your/key.ppk</pre><p>


You are done, it should work now. Let's give a try:
</p><pre>svn co svn+ssh://user@server/path/to/svn/repository</pre><p/>
