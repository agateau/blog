title: "Polishing KDE4"

<p>I have been busy these days helping polishing KDE4 user interface. I played a bit with SystemSettings: fixing margins and making the scrollbars which appeared when the page was too big a bit more usable, as you can see on these before/after screenshots:</p>
<div align="center"><a href="before_network_proxy.png" title="Network Proxy Settings, before"><img src="before_network_proxy.thumbnail.png" alt="Network Proxy Settings, before"/></a> <a href="after_network_proxy.png" title="Network Proxy Settings, after"><img src="after_network_proxy.thumbnail.png" alt="Network Proxy Settings, after"/></a></div>
Now at least the bottom button row is always reachable.
<p>I also spent some time on Konqueror settings dialog. It grows a bit less now, but it's still not perfect, as 6 pages are still more than 600 pixels high. HIG is not satisfied.</p>
