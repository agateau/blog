I defiantly think the css values should be in a datafile, good idea. It would be really neat if Dolphin adopted this automatically so any time I mouse over a image for that matter it would bring up these options. Maybe even an option to add it to the plasma desktop would be cool in a little frame, that's most likely too much.
