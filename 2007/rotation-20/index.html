title: "Rotation 2.0"

<p>A few days ago I committed a feature I have been wanting for a long time in Gwenview: rotating images directly from the thumbnail view. It works this way: when you move your mouse over a thumbnail, a small button bar appears. This button bar contains three buttons: save, rotate left and rotate right.</p>
<p>Mandatory screenshot:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="20071011-rotatethumbnailview.thumbnail.png" alt="20071011-rotatethumbnailview.png"/></p>
</a>
<p>It should be very handy to quickly fix the orientation of a set of images you just imported from your camera.</p>
<p>I played a bit with Qt stylesheets to produce the button bar. I think it looks nice, but the hardcoded black color might be out of place depending on your choice of thumbnail view background color and your desktop colorscheme. If you feel like improving it, the CSS rules are defined in thumbnailview.cpp, around line 78 (maybe I should move the CSS to a data file instead of hardcoding them in the source code).</p>
