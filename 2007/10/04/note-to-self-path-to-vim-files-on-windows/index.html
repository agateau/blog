<p>I have been wondering for a long time why my beloved Vim plugins would not load under Windows. It turns out Vim looks for them in <code>$HOME/vimfiles/plugins</code> under Windows. More information can be found with <code>:help runtimepath</code>.</p>
<p>Who knows, this might help other Unix refugees working on Windows.</p>
