title: "Crop this, sidebar edition"

<p>I  worked a bit more on image cropping in Gwenview. The new version no longer uses a floating dialog which was always coming in the way. The content of the crop dialog is now shown in place of the sidebar, as you can see on this screenshot:</p>
<a href="20071011-crop.png" title="Cropping widgets in the sidebar">
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="20071011-crop.thumbnail.png" alt="Cropping widgets in the sidebar"/></p>
</a>
