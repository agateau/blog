title: "CMake2assistant"

<p>I have been using <a href="http://www.proli.net/2007/09/17/cmake-help/">CMake Help</a> for a while, but I was missing some of the nice features of Qt Assistant. I first thought about adding those missing features, but I realized it would be even nicer to go the other way: integrate CMake documentation in Qt Assistant.</p>
<p>The result is CMake2assistant, which you can grab from <a href="http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/CMake2assistant?content=67492&amp;PHPSESSID=aec60058a17d433a31e47aed2d0ffceb">qt-apps.org</a>. Quoting the README:
<blockquote><span class="smallcontenttext">This tool parses CMake output to generate an HTML cross-referenced version of CMake commands and modules. It also generates a .dcf file which can be used to integrate the CMake documentation in Qt Assistant v3 or v4.</span></blockquote>
Since I know all you are looking for is screenshots, here are some pictures to feed your pixel hunger.
