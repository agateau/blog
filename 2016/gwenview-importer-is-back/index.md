title: Gwenview Importer is back
summary: |
    Ported Gwenview Importer to KDE Frameworks 5.

I spent some time over the last weeks to port Gwenview Importer to KDE Frameworks 5, as I was getting frustrated with importing pictures by hand.

It missed the KDE Applications 16.12 release but will be in the next one.
