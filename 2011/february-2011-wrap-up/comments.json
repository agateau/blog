I don't think it fits Gwenview use case though: from what I understand a blink comparator is useful to highlight differences between two very similar images whereas in the case of comparing pictures there will most likely be lots of differences due to movements of the camera or of the subject, different camera settings. I don't think it would make sense to \"diff\" the image.</p>","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"id":"dsq-457711732","author":"Emil Sedgh","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2011-02-27T00:59:30Z","message":"<p>Hi Aurélien.</p><p>Last week i noticed that svg kpart renders very poorly comparing to khtml and/or webkit.<br>May i ask why its not being removed?

I must confess I do not actively work on it, it's basically in maintenance mode. It was created because at that time Gwenview used KParts and needed a way to render SVG. It does not use KPart anymore, but I kept SVG Part alive on the basis that it was useful for Konqueror. If Konqueror does a better job at rendering SVG, then maybe SVG Part can go now.</p>","replies":[]}]},{"id":"dsq-457711733","author":"prostosuper","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2011-02-27T04:47:58Z","message":"<p>Just wanted to thank you for awesome image viewer.
