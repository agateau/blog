title: "June 2011 wrap-up"

<p>8th of July, high time for June wrap up...</p>
<p>I was away for a little less than two weeks in June, as I attended the Qt Contributor Summit (see <a href="http://agateau.com/2011/06/19/qt-contributor-summit-2011/">report</a>) and a Canonical Sprint.</p>
<h3>Gwenview</h3>
<p>Most of my time this month was spent on Gwenview, polishing it to be ready for the KDE SC 4.7 release. Here is the list of changes I made:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://agateau.com/2011/06/03/hunting-down-black-screens/">Black screen fixes</a></li>
<li>Thumbnails are now automatically refreshed when they are modified from a KIPI plugin or outside Gwenview. Additionally, the user can press F5 in thumbnail mode to force a thumbnail refresh.</li>
<li>In the importer, the "Import all" button is now only enabled if there are documents to import.</li>
<li>The crop tool got reworked:
        <ul>
<li>The widget now remains visible when zooming and scrolling</li>
<li>The widget adjusts its position when the window is enlarged</li>
<li>The crop side handles are always visible even when one zoom to
            a point where only part of the crop selection is visible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other smaller bug fixes...</li>
</ul>
<h3>"Common UI mistakes in KDE applications" series</h3>
<p>
    I didn't write any new article for my series on common UI mistakes in KDE applications but I created <a href="http://agateau.com/article-series/common-ui-mistakes-in-kde-applications/">a page to link them all</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I would like to add links to the page from the articles themselves but I need advice on the best way to do this without causing Planet KDE and Planet Ubuntu to repost them. Any idea?
</p>
<h3>Desktop Summit</h3>
<p>
I registered for the Desktop Summit, and will hopefully be holding a workshop there, more on this later.
</p>
<h3>Skanlite</h3>
<p>Finally I did some work on <a href="http://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/skanlite">Skanlite</a>, which I use quite a lot to scan my receipts.
<ul>
<li>Removed crosshair cursor from view scrollbars</li>
<li>Added colon for property labels</li>
<li>Moved checkbox labels to the right</li>
<li>Proposed use of KIntNumInput and KDoubleNumInput to replace home-made widgets (not in yet)</li>
</ul>
</p><p>I have other ideas for Skanlite. Time will tell if I get some of them done in July (and if K&#229;re, Skanlite maintainer, accepts them of course)
