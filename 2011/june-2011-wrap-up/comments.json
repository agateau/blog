One problem is generating all thumbnails for a very large photo folder could be quite resource-intensive because right now all thumbnails are kept in memory. Another problem is to ensure decoding the requested image is given a higher priority than generating thumbnails. I agree the current behavior is not optimal though.

I actually like the fact Gwenview is smart and zooms smoothly until it doesn't make sense anymore (200% and more). Above 200% an un-smoothed image offers more clarity while between 100 and 200 the smoothing DOES improve it. I think it's better to have Gwenview behave smart than configurable ;-)</p>","replies":[]}]}]
