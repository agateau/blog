Does this only affect the fullscreen like demonstrated in the video or also the normal view (I doubt they use different code?^^)<br>2. Does OpenGL now also take over picture magnification/zooming? So you could animate zooming into a picture as well and use for example Lanczos filter to anti-alias the pictures or so. <br>I hope you can make the zoom steps a bit smoother, it feels like first it is \"Fit to screen\", then it is \"Original size\" and then you zoom it, but it feels to weird because the zoom steps are not regular.<br>3.
