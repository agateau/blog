Are you a developer looking for help with the user interface of your application?
<p>Are you currently attending Desktop Summit?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to these two questions, come visit the <a href="http://wiki.desktopsummit.org/Workshops_%26_BoFs/2011/UI_Clinic">KDE UI Clinic</a> on Thursday at 14:00 in room 1.405! Our resident practitioners, <a href="http://pinheiro-kde.blogspot.com/">Nuno</a> (of Oxygen fame) and Aur&#233;lien (of Gwenview and I-write-about-myself-at-the-3rd-person fame), will be happy to look with you at your application and deliver a prescription to fix any usability or design issue.</p>
<p>See you on Thursday!</p>
