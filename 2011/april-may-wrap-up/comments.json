BUT, they relied on background handwriting recognition getting the words right, so you were never sure if search failed because it didn't recognize your \"KMessageWidget\", so it made many users anxious and/or they'd spend time correcting recognition instead of taking notes; but if you're not going to attempt recognition, why get a tablet over a paper notebook?
