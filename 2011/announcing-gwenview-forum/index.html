title: "Announcing Gwenview Forum"

<p>Gwenview has had a mailing-list for a very long time now, but time changes. Nowadays I believe forums are more appropriate for end-users discussions than mailing-lists for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forum do not require setting up individual passwords for every topic you are interested in.</li>
<li>It is easier to join an existing conversation on a forum you just discovered than on a mailing list you have not subscribed yet.</li>
<li>It is easier for non-technical users to read and join a forum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore I asked for a Gwenview forum to be created on forum.kde.org. You can find it <a href="http://forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=213">forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=213</a> (too bad forums do not get nicer urls :/). Come and ask your questions here!</p>
<p>I plan to phase out the mailing-list. I haven't yet decided of a day when it will be turned off but it's probably going to happen in a month or two. After that the only remaining bit of SourceForge infrastructure used for Gwenview will be the (outdated) website, maybe I'll get around to create a site for Gwenview under kde.org domain...</p>
