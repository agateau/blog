title: "Polishing Randr KCM a bit"

<p>Inspired by Alex work on <a href="http://www.afiestas.org/display-configuration-in-kde-workspace-4-7-1/">display configuration in KDE</a>, I gave the Randr KCM some love. There is still work to do: I believe it could be vastly simplified (Alex has a plan for that!) but at least I find it a bit more pleasant to use now.</p>
<p>Here is an annotated screenshot of the changes:</p>
