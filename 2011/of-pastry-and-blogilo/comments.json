There is not much to gain from being able to move the dock to the left or to the right and the close button can be a bit dangerous as it is one-way only: it makes it easy to close a dock but provides no way to bring it back, you must provide a menu-item/toolbar-button to do so. This element you add is nicer IMO because it is not one-way only.</p>","replies":[]},{"id":"dsq-457711930","author":"gaboo","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2011-09-15T11:28:18Z","message":"<p>What wonderful cakes! :)</p>","replies":[]},{"id":"dsq-457711931","author":"Kyriakos Brastianos","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2011-09-15T12:35:49Z","message":"<p>Nice improvements Aurélien.:)<br>votre femme fait des gâteaux super</p>","replies":[]},{"id":"dsq-457711933","author":"g","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2011-09-15T15:50:59Z","message":"<p>These cakes are pure art!!!</p><p>So your wife's name is Gwen, so that's where the name Gwenview is coming from: you wrote an application to view the thousands of photos of your wife (and as a side-effect also other images can be viewed) ;-)</p>","replies":[{"id":"dsq-457712533","author":"Aurélien","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2011-09-15T16:30:38Z","message":"<p>The cakes came after Gwenview, but yes, there is a link between Gwenview and my wife...</p>","replies":[]}]},{"id":"dsq-457711935","author":"thorGT","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2011-09-16T00:33:57Z","message":"<p>Nice work!<br>How do you manage to get your work approved bythe apps' authors?
