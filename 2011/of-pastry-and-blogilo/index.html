title: "Of pastry and Blogilo..."

<p>My wife enjoys cooking and recently got into creating decorated cakes. I suggested she starts a blog to show her creations instead of only sharing them on Facebook.</p>
<div>She had some prior experience with Wordpress, but found the web-based editor painful to use: our Internet connection is not very fast so uploading images with the web-based editor is a pain. It would have been especially annoying to populate the blog with her existing pictures. So I looked around and gave Blogilo a try.</div>
<div>Blogilo is quite nice, but I found out it felt a bit cramped on her 1024x600 netbook, so I decided to look into it, see if I could make it more usable on a small screen. After a few commits, I find it a bit nicer. Mandatory before/after picture:</div>
<div><a href="blogilo-before-after.png"><img src="thumb_blogilo-before-after.png" title="Blogilo, before/after" height="91" width="300" alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-968"/></a></div>
<div>Not mentioned on this picture are the following changes:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The first row of tabs is hidden when only one entry is edited. This saves a bit of vertical space.</li>
<li>Icons and tooltips of some buttons in the toolbox have been adjusted to be more consistent with the rest of KDE.</li>
<li>Toolbox visibility is now correctly remembered at startup. Hiding the toolbox of course saves a lot of horizontal space.</li>
<li>Size of editor toolbar icons is no longer hard-coded to 22x22.</li>
</ul>
<div>With those changes implemented we were able to populate her blog quickly. There is still room for improvements though, in particular I would like to have support for thumbnails. Being forced to use full-sized images is a pain.</div>
