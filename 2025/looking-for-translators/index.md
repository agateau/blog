title: Pixel Wheels is looking for translators

Breaking news! I am preparing for version 1.0.0 of Pixel Wheels!

I need some help though. Pixel Wheels is translated in quite a few languages, thanks to the great work of kind people who took the time to make the game accessible to more players.

Unfortunately some translations are outdated. Real life gets in the way: some translators do not have the time anymore to update their work, or have become unreachable.

<!-- break -->

These translations in particular are looking for a new translator:

- Bengali: 50% complete, last update: November 2021
- Swedish: 77% complete, last update: October 2022
- Italian: 81% complete, last update: February 2023

Would you be interested in taking over one of them? Great! You can learn more about translating the game from the [translator documentation](https://github.com/agateau/pixelwheels/blob/master/docs/translations.md). You can then contact me [via email](mailto:mail@agateau.com) or directly open a pull-request on [Pixel Wheels GitHub repository](https://github.com/agateau/pixelwheels).

Of course *new* translations are always welcome too, let me know if you want to translate Pixel Wheels to another language!
