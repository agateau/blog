In July I [announced Pixel Wheels 1.0 rc1][rc1] and wrote:

[rc1]: ../pixelwheels-1-0-0-rc1-is-out/

> Pending no critical bugs, 1.0 should be next, hopefully not too long after (famous last words!)

And here we are: it's the end of December and I finally published Pixel Wheels 1.0... Famous last words indeed 😅.

Let's start with the Official launch trailer!

## What's new?

There aren't a lot of changes in this version, which is a good sign considering that the previous version was a release candidate. Let's have a look at them.

### HUD improvements

I improved the "pie buttons" that are used to control the game on mobile:

- You can now make them bigger if necessary;
- They are easier to use thanks to their hit zones now extending as far as possible;
- I fixed a bug in the way the HUD images were generated that caused them to end up flat. Now they once again have a little edge, which looks neat I think.

### Indonesian translation

Pixel Wheels learned to speak Indonesian, thanks to Neko Nekowazarashi. It always makes me happy when new translations are added because it makes the game usable by more people.

## Get it!

You can install Pixel Wheels on your computer. It works on  Linux, macOS¹, Windows:

<a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.agateau.PixelWheels"><img class="get-button" src="/static/images/get-it-pixelart/get-flathub.png" alt="Get it on Flathub"></a>
<a href="https://agateau.itch.io/pixelwheels"><img class="get-button" src="/static/images/get-it-pixelart/get-itchio.png" alt="Get in on itch.io"></a>

¹: Unfortunately the macOS version is still Intel only. I no longer have access to a Mac machine, so it's not possible for me to add ARM support. Help is welcome!

You can also install it on your Android device:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agateau.tinywheels.android"><img class="get-button" src="/static/images/get-it-pixelart/get-gplay.png" alt="Get in on Google Play"></a>

## What's next?

For now there aren't going to be major new features, but I expect some bug fix releases. I already have some more changes lined up for the HUD, and Google is telling me the game needs some update to satisfy its ever growing list of requirements :).

As I mentioned earlier, some help to get a macOS ARM release out would also be awesome.

That's it for now, I hope you enjoy this 1.0 release!
