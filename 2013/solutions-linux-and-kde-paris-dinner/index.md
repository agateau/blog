Next week is [Solutions Linux][sl], a yearly Linux exhibition in Paris. As
usual, KDE has a booth there. As usual, we are late at getting things ready, but
we should have a few laptops running KDE SC 4.10 and KDE master. Suggestions on
interesting new features to demonstrate are more than welcome!

This year we also have a KDE Paris Dinner on Tuesday evening, at 21h. Location
has not been defined but it will be in Paris (of course). If you are interested,
add your name to [the list][dinner].

Hope to see you there!
