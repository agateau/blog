Burger Party needed a "boss" for the last level of the US world. After some
thinking, I decided on a wrestler.

First I did a quick sketch:

Then came up with a first version:

But he was not tall enough, and looked a bit like he needed to visit the
bathroom... Today I reworked it, here is version 2.

↑ He looks very happy to visit your restaurant.

↑ Now he is getting a bit annoyed...

↑ This is really taking too long for him!

I am still not sure about the color of his attire, opinions are welcome!
