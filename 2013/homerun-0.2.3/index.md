    Another bug fix release of Homerun, with a few fixes and more translations

As [announced][homerun022] two weeks ago, here is another release of
[Homerun][homerun].

This new release comes with many more translations (16 complete translations,
and 4 more than 80% complete). It also includes some fixes:

- The "Alt-Up" shortcut key to go up one level when navigating is back
- The "Power" source no longer uses internal DBus APIs, making it work again with upcoming KDE SC 4.11 (Thanks to Hrvoje Senjan for this fix)

That's about it. As usual, you can get the tarball from [download.kde.org][dl].
