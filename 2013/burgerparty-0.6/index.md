Time for a new release of Burger Party!

Many invisible adjustments in this new one, the most visible change is the work
on world 1, with a new background and a new end-of-world boss: the wrestler (see
[previous article][wrestler]).

Some work has also be done on the world selection screen, with a cleaner
separation between world and sandbox buttons, as well as star counts.

Here is a more complete list of changes:

- The animation announcing a new items is not played again when retrying the
  level
- Fries and soda are now available from the beginning
- The "meal done" sound has been changed
- Texts are now more readable, thanks to a thin border around the letters
- US world:
    - Boss for last level is now a wrestler
    - New city-like background
- A few changes on the screen to select world or sandbox mode:
    - Number of unlocked stars and total stars are now shown on world buttons
    - One can no longer select worlds until they have been unlocked
    - A thin separator has been added between the world buttons and the sandbox
      button
- Sandbox mode:
    - Just like in the world screen, one can no longer select worlds until they
      have been unlocked
    - The "done" button now uses the "meal done" sound
