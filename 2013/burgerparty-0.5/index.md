Here is a new alpha version of Burger Party. This new release comes with the following changes:

- Reworked burger scrolling: target burgers scroll in their bubble now instead of scrolling the whole view
- Sand box: use proper icons and world-specific buttons
- Hopefully fixed black screen on resume
- Added (early version of) music in menu screens
- Reworked menu screens: only one play button, then player picks either a world or the sand box mode

[Get it now](/projects/burgerparty/)!
