title: I am going to Akademy!

So after a (too long) break, I am going back to Akademy this year! Having been away from KDE work for a while now, this will be the first time I attend the conference as a user. It's going to be interesting to see how this feels. In any case, I am looking forward to the sessions and to catching up with old friends.

<!-- break -->

I will only be attending the first two days unfortunately, but I will try to make the best of these days to meet as many people as possible.

Now time to go packing, as I am actually landing in Vienna tomorrow to do some sightseeing before the conference. See you there!
