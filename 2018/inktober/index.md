title: Inktober 2018

If you have been wondering about the lack of progress on Pixel Wheels, it's partly because last month I participated again to Inktober, the yearly event where you have to produce one drawing a day every day during October.

The [Inktober][] site provides word lists for each day, you don't have to use them, but I find having a word everyday helps getting started.

Like [last year](/2017/inktober), I also picked a recurring theme. This year it was robots.

Here are all the drawings I did:

Just like last year, I ended up quite tired, but it was tougher this year because I injured the ring finger of my main hand. It was not too severe but still required surgery. I am happy that I have been able to keep up with the drawings nevertheless, and finish in time.
