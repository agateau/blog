Implement the sidebar in the same way as dolphin's panels.  That is they can be dragged to whichever side of the screen you want, but tabbed, have on above the other, or be on opposite sides.  Doing that allows the user to choose any of the layouts you just mentioned.  This has the added advantage of being more flexible, you can add additional panels in the future with having to worry as much.  It has the disadvantage of making it hard to hide the whole thing, since people might want to hide one panel or both.  However, making it so wherever there is a panel there is a collapse/expand button.  Perhaps it would be in the form of an arrow in the top inner corner of the panel pointing towards the top outer corner.  So for a panel on the right the arrow would face to the right and be in the upper left corner of the panel.  When collapsed, the arrow would switch direction.  Alternatively, there could just be separate toolbar buttons for each panel.</p><p>2. Similar to the above, except the panel always has a tab (even if there is only one) and the tab is vertical.  Clicking on it when that panel is open hides it.  Clicking on it when another panel is open switches to that panel (when the two panels are stacked).</p>","replies":[]},{"id":"dsq-457710196","author":"TheBlackCat","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2009-02-01T12:46:39Z","message":"<p>I should add that my option 2 is how Amarok 2 currently implements the collection manager on the left.</p>","replies":[]},{"id":"dsq-457710199","author":"Michael","deleted":false,"createdAt":"2009-02-01T13:18:59Z","message":"<p>Hi,</p><p>I really love gwenview especially the new nepomuk features :-)<br>I like the simple detail view of dolphin.

This would (a) retain the elegant simplicity of the current sidebar, (b) accomplish the goal, and (c) actually, I think, be more discoverable than options (1), (3), and depending on implementation (4), because it uses the same UI as the rest of the sidebar: people see that it's a sidebar and that it's got operations and stuff in it, but they may not expect to also look for tabs or mode-switching buttons, and so may simply miss them.
