title: "Advice on Linux friendly usb soundcard"

<p>I am preparing for an upcoming party, where I will be in charge of the music. I managed to borrow a amplifier and a set of loudspeakers, and decided I would mix the music with my laptop. While I would not call me a DJ, I played with DJ mixers in the past for other parties, so I am familiar with the process.</p>
<p>I plan to use <a href="http://www.mixxx.org/">Mixxx</a> to play music, but I need to buy the latest missing piece: an usb soundcard. It will be used to output the sound to the amplifier, while my headphones will be plugged to the internal soundcard for preview purposes. This means I do not need fancy 5:1 output, just a reliable, Linux friendly, usb soundcard.</p>
<p>Dear lazyweb, can you recommend models which would suit my needs?</p>
