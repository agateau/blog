title: "\"Fix the TV, daddy!\""

<p>Yesterday when I came back home, Clara greeted me with "Daddy, can you bring your tools and fix the TV?".</p>
<p>I stood a bit puzzled, until my wife explained Clara was watching a DVD when the DVD player decided to stop reading, probably unhappy with the state of the disc.</p>
<p>Just like Caleb believes <a href="http://www.stormyscorner.com/2009/01/mommy-do-it.html">his mommy can do it</a>, Clara seems to believe I can fix everything with my tools :-)</p>
