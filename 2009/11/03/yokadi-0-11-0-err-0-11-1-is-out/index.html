title: "Yokadi 0.11.0, err 0.11.1 is out!"

<p>After quite some work, we are proud to announce a new release of Yokadi, the command-line driven, geek friendly, sqlite backed TODO list. This new release brings quite a few changes compared to 0.10. Quoting <a href="http://yokadi.github.com/2009/11/01/version-0.11.0-has-been-released.html">the announcement</a>:
<blockquote>Version 0.11.0 brings you a much nicer t_list output:
<ul>
<li>The width of the title column now adjusts itself to fit your terminal width and the content to display.</li>
<li>Task keywords are now printed in the title column.</li>
<li>Using the new -k switch, you can group tasks by keywords instead of grouping them by project.</li>
</ul>
0.11.0 also brings you a few handy shortcuts:
<ul>
<li>Special character &#8216;_&#8217; can be used to represent last task id in all task commands: handy to add a due date after adding a task: just type &#8220;t_due _ tomorrow&#8221; to set the last used task due date to tomorrow.</li>
<li>Custom aliases can be defined for all commands with a_add.</li>
</ul>
Other changes:
<ul>
<li>Bugs keywords are prefixed with a &#8216;_&#8217; to distinguish them from user keywords.</li>
<li>YOKADI_DB environment variable can be defined to set default yokadi database path.</li>
<li>Switch from &#8220;GPL v3&#8221; to &#8220;GPL v3 or newer&#8221; license.</li>
</ul>

Version 0.11.0 also contained a silly <a href="http://yokadi.github.com/2009/11/02/0.11.1-brown-bag-release.html">last-minute mistake</a>, hence the blog title, but it's all fixed now, <a href="http://yokadi.github.com/download.html">get it</a>!</p>
