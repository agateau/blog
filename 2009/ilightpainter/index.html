title: "ILightPainter"

<p>Two friends of mine recently started to experiment with iPhone development, and just published their first application: ILightPainter. It's a light painting application, which makes it possible to create beautiful pictures such as this one:</p>
<a href="http://iphone.bnb.free.fr/wp-content/icon_big.jpeg"><img src="thumb_ilightpainter.jpeg" title="ILightPainter example" height="300" width="300" alt="ILightPainter example" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-167"/>
</a>
<p>This is not computer generated imagery: it was produced by moving an iPhone running ILightPainter in front of a standing still digital camera with low shutter speed. Be sure to check the Wikipedia page to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_painting">learn more about light painting</a>, then if you are an iPhone/iPod owner, why not&#160; <a href="http://iphone.bnb.free.fr/?p=16">give ILightPainter a try</a>!</p>
