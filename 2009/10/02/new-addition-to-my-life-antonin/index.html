title: "New addition to my life: Antonin"

<p>Yesterday evening, at 21:21, Antonin realized staying inside his mother was no longer possible and decided to explore a new world, ours.</p>
<p>Everything went very well. Baby and mother are OK. Antonin's sister is eagerly waiting for them to come back home and his father better hurry up assembling his wardrobe and bed (he was expected to arrive at the end of the month, not the beginning!).</p>
<p>As a father of a new born baby, I think you can trust my words when I tell you he is the cutest baby on earth (even if I may have already&#160;<a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/1898" title="Clara, 8th wonder of the world">written something similar</a>, 3 and a half years ago). But should you doubt it, here is the proof:</p>
