title: "Exciting change!"

<p>My professional career is about to change one more time... In two weeks I leave <a href="http://www.openwide.fr">Open Wide</a> for <a href="http://canonical.com">Canonical</a>, joining the Desktop Experience team as a KDE developer.</p>
<p>I spent some good time in the <a href="http://www.os4i.com">OS4I business unit</a> of Open Wide. In the jungle of consulting companies, Open Wide is a human-sized company and a nice place to work (especially if you like Japanese food!)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I just could not ignore the opportunity of getting paid to work on what has become an important part of my life for quite some time now: KDE. And now that I live one hour from Paris, the possibility of working from home made the position even more enticing.</p>
<p>So, that's it, yet another job change. I am looking forward for the new challenges! <em>(hmm... who said "Notifications"?)</em></p>
