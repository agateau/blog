title: "And now for something different, introducing Yokadi"

<p>For the last few months, when I was not busy hacking on Gwenview or other parts of KDE, I spent some time together with S&#233;bastien Renard (of KDE France fame) creating <a href="http://yokadi.github.com">Yokadi</a>.</p>
<p>Yokadi is a command-line based, sqlite powered, TODO list. It is designed to be fast and efficient. I have been using it to manage all my tasks, including Gwenview bug reports (see "<a href="http://yokadi.github.com/bugtracking.html">Using Yokadi as a bugtracker</a>"). In these days of GUI applications, a command-line one might seem outdated, but it turns out I am more efficient with this tool than with a GUI or web application, especially when used together with <a href="http://yakuake.kde.org">Yakuake</a>. Of course, your experience may vary.</p>
<p>Today we released the first stable version of Yokadi: version 0.9.0. If you are looking for a fast and efficient way to handle your tasks, organize them by projects, with support for keywords, urgency, due date and optional long multi-line descriptions, <a href="http://yokadi.github.com">give it a try</a>!</p>
<p>Update: Fixed the link to "Using Yokadi as a bugtracker".</p>
