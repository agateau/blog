title: "Yokadi 0.10.0 is out!"

<p>Last week S&#233;bastien Renard and me decided to do an Akademy release of <a href="http://yokadi.github.com" title="Yokadi">Yokadi</a>, our command-line-based, sqlite-powered TODO list. Quite a few changes, among which:
<ul>
<li>Ability to assign keywords to a project.</li>
<li>Shortened some commands (old ones are still available but are considered deprecated):
<ul>
<li>t_set_due =&gt; t_due</li>
<li>t_set_project =&gt; t_project</li>
<li>t_set_urgency =&gt; t_urgency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed keyword syntax: use @foo instead of -k foo.</li>
<li>Added t_recurs command to define task recursion (weekly, monthly, yearly&#8230;)</li>
<li>Added full text search with t_list -s foo.</li>
<li>Enhanced t_list display.</li>
<li>Added purge command (t_purge) to remove old tasks.</li>
<li>Added Windows support.</li>
<li>Fixed install script to be more friendly to users and packagers.</li>
</ul>
Most of these changes are the result of hard work from S&#233;bastien, while I mainly played the anti-bloat gatekeeper and polished a few things here and there.</p>
<p>Yokadi is getting more and more powerful, but we try hard to keep it simple and usable. Give it a try, you may like it! (It has been <a href="http://kdedevelopers.org/node/4017">recommended by David Faure</a>, one of the most productive KDE hacker on earth, so there must be something about it :-))</p>
