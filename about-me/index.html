<p>So you want to know a little bit more about me?</p>
<p>My name is Aur&#233;lien G&#226;teau, I am a French software engineer currently living in a small village near Paris with his wife, daughter and son.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I wanted to be a cartoonist. That was before I stumbled on this strange plastic thing they call a computer. I met my first one when I was 9 year old. It was an Amstrad CPC464 and it changed my life. From this day on, I knew I would be a developer. I never stopped writing code since then.</p>
<p>I still enjoy drawing, even if I lack the time to create real compositions nowadays. I guess the combination of these two passions is what got me interested in software usability, design and imaging.</p>
