My name is Aurélien Gâteau, I am a French software engineer currently living in
a small village near Paris with my wife and children.

When I was a child, I wanted to be a cartoonist. That was before I stumbled on
this strange plastic thing they call a computer. I met my first one when I was
9 year old. It was an Amstrad CPC464 and it changed my life. From this day on,
I knew I would be a developer. I never stopped writing code since then.

I still enjoy drawing, even if I lack the time to create real compositions
nowadays. I guess the combination of these two passions is what got me
interested in user experience, design and imaging.
