      1 - Crystal. Protoss uses crystal to build their powering pylons.
- full: 02-suit.jpg
  alt: >
      2 - Suit. The "Powered Combat Suit" of the Confederate Marine Corps.
- full: 03-vessel.jpg
  alt: >
      3 - Vessel. Another Starcraft 2 Terran unit: the science vessel.
- full: 04-knot.jpg
  alt: >
      4 - Knot. This one was a bit hard to associate with Starcraft 2. I settled for Nova trying an hair knot.
- full: 05-raven.jpg
  alt: >
      5 - Raven. The Raven is a StarCraft 2 terran drone capable of detecting cloaked and burrowed enemies; as well as building turrets, defense drones and seeker missiles on the fly. Quite an impressive piece of engineering!
- full: 06-spirit.jpg
  alt: >
      6 - Spirit. This is a dragoon, a Starcraft protoss unit. When a great protoss warrior is critically wounded, his mangled body can be transfered into a dragoon. The cybernetics core then bond the warrior *spirit* with the dragoon machinery, allowing the fallen warrior to control the dragoon as if it was his own body.

  alt: >
      7 - Fan. Today is a bit more creative than the previous ones. Here is an angry Arcturus Mensk fan. Notice the "Make Dominium Great Again" cap :)
- full: 08-watch.jpg
  alt: >
      8 - Watch. "All hands brace for warp jump on my mark!" Matt Horner's watch from one of the first StarCraft 2 cut scenes.
- full: 09-pressure.jpg
  alt: >
      9 - Pressure. This marine is under some serious Zerg pressure. Let's hope the medivac is not too far away...
- full: 10-pick.jpg
  alt: >
      10 - Pick. Even Protoss have to eat! This high templar picks a fruit from an Aiur Apple tree to satisfy his hunger.
- full: 11-sour.jpg
  alt: >
      11 - Sour. Hydralisks do not like when marines use stim-packs: not because they become harder to kill, but because it gives a sour state to their meat! It is not a well known fact, but they have a delicate palate!
- full: 12-stuck.jpg
  alt: >
      12 - Stuck. This Viking got abandoned on the battlefield, and is now stuck in Zerg creep.
- full: 13-roof.jpg
  alt: >
      13 - Roof. Another abandoned piece of equipment. This time it's a terran factory. It has been turned into a cosy house by some ingenious mind. The roof now features a clothes line and a toboggan for the kids.
- full: 14-tick.jpg
  alt: >
      14 - Tick. A new Zerg mutation has been reported on the battlefield: The Zerg tick!
- full: 15-helmet.jpg
  alt: >
      15 - Helmet. A Protoss zealot helmet.
- full: 16-compass.jpg
  alt: >
      16 - Compass. This one is a bit far fetched as I couldn't find a compass in StarCraft universe. I imagined that if units had one it would be integrated in their Head Up Display.
- full: 17-collide.jpg
  alt: >
      17 - Collide. When ultralisks defy each other, you'd better stay away from their charge!
- full: 18-moon.jpg
  alt: >
      18 - Moon. This one is a cross-over: I had a hard time coming up with an idea to mix "StarCraft" and "moon". I hope you enjoy the reference :) Also, my brown marker is dying, so next drawing might use a slightly different color.
- full: 19-loop.jpg
  alt: >
      19 - Loop. Contrary to public perception, Zerglings are actually cute creatures: look at this two buddies chasing each other tail, looping around a spore crawler!
- full: 20-sprout.jpg
  alt: >
      20 - Sprout. Nature is taking over this old abandoned Protoss nexus, and sprouts have turned into a sizeable tree. Trying a more minimalist approach on coloring with this one.
- full: 21-fuzzy.jpg
  alt: >
      21 - Fuzzy. I don't know which one is more frightening: the regular ultralisk or its toundra cousin: the pink fuzzy ultralisk!
- full: 22-open.jpg
  alt: >
      22 - Open. You really can't trust this Bob guy.
- full: 23-leak.jpg
  alt: >
      23 - Leak. This Hellion got hit pretty badly. The armoring protected most of the vehicle, but one bullet punctured an oil tank, causing an serious leak.
- full: 24-extinct.jpg
  alt: >
      24 - Extinct. Terrans do not need anyone to kill themselves... The population of this planet just got annihilated. Not my most joyful drawing, but the theme was pretty dark.
- full: 25-splat.jpg
  alt: >
      25 - Splat. This wounded Protoss warrior did not have much time to enjoy his return as a dragoon. One has to be careful when ultralisks are around.
- full: 26-connect.jpg
  alt: >
      26 - Connect. A Protoss connecting to a Xel'Naga, Protoss creators. Hope you got the reference ;) Tried something different with coloring this day. It's a good thing I replaced my almond marker a few days ago!
- full: 27-spark.jpg
  alt: >
      27 - Spark. Rory Swann, chief engineer of the Hyperion, is busy welding something in the armory.
- full: 28-crispy.jpg
  alt: >
      28 - Crispy. Don't trust firebats with your meat!
- full: 29-patch.jpg
  alt: >
      29 - Patch. Had a hard time coming up with a StarCraft idea today. I thought about going meta (or Meta? ahahâ€¦) and draw something about game patches but instead I decided to create a patch for an imaginary Terran mercenary org: the "Riot Tigers".
- full: 30-slither.jpg
  alt: >
      30 - Slither. For this one I tried to imagine what a Zerg snake would look like. Ended up with lots of spikes, pointy teeth and some hydralisk-like shape for the back of its skull.
- full: 31-risk.jpg
  alt: >
      31 - Risk. Even for a fully cloaked ghost, infiltrating a Zerg base like this is a risky move.
