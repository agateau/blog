## Introduction

Last month was a release month! As I hinted in my previous status update, I had a bunch of overdue releases to publish, and I am happy to report they all went out!

## Clyde

On June 16, I released [Clyde 0.8.0](https://github.com/agateau/clyde/releases/0.8.0). This new version does not bring game-changing modifications, but it makes Clyde nicer to use.

I am especially happy with `clyde doc` new ability to list the URLs for the homepage and repository of a package: this ensures there is always a way to get a bit of information about a given app.

## SFXR-Qt

On June 24, I released [SFXR-Qt 1.5.1](https://github.com/agateau/sfxr-qt/releases/1.5.1). I wrote a [short article](../sfxr-qt-1-5-1/) about this new version if you want to know more.

## Burger Party

On June 30, I released [Burger Party 1.4.4](/projects/burgerparty). This new release makes the game available in another new language: this time it's Hungarian, thanks to Balázs Úr!

## What's next?

In July we will probably see a new Pixel Wheels release, stay tuned!
